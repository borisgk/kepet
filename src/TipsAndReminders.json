        "Tip": "Monitor your pet's time outside. In the winter, frigid temperatures can cause frostbite on your dog's ears, paws, and tail. In the summer months, heat can dehydrate your pup and cause heat stroke. Make sure you keep an eye on the weather and limit your dog's time outside in extreme weather."

      {
        "Tip": "Pay close attention to your dog's paws. In the winter months, salt and ice can contribute to cracks in the pads of your pet's feet. While in the summer months, hot asphalt or concrete can create burns and cause pain. Consider using booties to protect your dog's paws, or try walking in the grass."

      {
        "Tip": "Steer clear of toxic algae. When hiking, walking, or simply venturing around your property, a run-in with water containing toxic algae, such as blue-green algae, can make your dog very sick. Check your local Parks and Recreation department, municipality, or conservation area to identify bodies of water that could contain harmful bacteria or toxins that may make your dog sick."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Avoid leaving your pet in a hot car. Never leave your dog unsupervised in the car. Even if you think the weather outside is comfortable, temperatures can quickly reach dangerous levels, putting your dog at risk for serious illness or death. You may also be subjected to animal cruelty penalties under municipal, provincial, or federal legislation."

        "Tip": "Meet Your Dog's Basic Needs. As a dog owner, it's essential to understand and meet your pet's basic needs. Whether you're a novice pet parent or an expert, you'll need to set the stage for your new pup. Your dog's basic needs will consist of nutritious food, water, treats, toys, and bedding to make the pup feel right at home."

      {
        "Tip": "Monitor food consumption. Pet obesity is on the rise, with an estimated 50% of pets being diagnosed as overweight or obese. Weight control and management is the number one thing a pet owner can do to increase the length and quality of their pet's life. Unfortunately, overweight canines are susceptible to many health risks such as metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, or poor immune systems. While you may want to spoil your pet, avoid spoiling them with food."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Provide sufficient water throughout the day. All dogs need to have clean and fresh water available at all times of the day. Make sure to replenish the water and wash all food and water dishes so they don't hold bacteria."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Regularly groom your dog. Regularly grooming your pet ensures they are clean and pest-free. While some dogs only need a bath every few months, others need regular grooming. If your dog sheds, you'll want to brush them often."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Nail trimming is also a must. Neglecting to trim your dog's nails can cause health problems such as injured tendons and deformed feet."

        "Tip": "Maintain Your Dog's Health with Routine Care. Proactively tending to your pet's well-being and health care ensures it lives the very best and healthiest life possible."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Schedule annual check-ups with your vet. One of the best ways to keep your pet healthy is to visit the vet regularly so they can examine your dog for any health concerns."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Maintain proper vaccinations. Vaccinations help protect your dog's body from invasive diseases. Standard canine vaccines usually include parvovirus, distemper, rabies, and canine hepatitis. If you groom or board your pooch, you may also need a vaccine against Bordetella bronchiseptica, which can cause kennel cough. Your vet can help pinpoint the vaccines appropriate for your hound."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Consider spaying or neutering your pet (depends on the gender of the animal). Spaying and neutering pets isn't just about population control—it can help protect your canine companion from certain diseases. For example, spaying your female dog can decrease her chances of uterus infections and breast tumors. Neutering male dogs can protect them from testicular cancer and prostate concerns."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Brush your dog's teeth. While often overlooked, dental care is also essential for maintaining your pet's health. Regularly brushing your pup's teeth can help prevent dental illnesses that can end up affecting your dog's kidney and liver function."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Choose insurance for your pet."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Stimulate Your Dog's Brain and Body. A balance of physical and mental stimulation plays a significant role in your dog's health. It can also encourage good behavior while discouraging harmful behaviors that can wreak havoc on your patience and home. As the saying goes: A tired dog is a good dog."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Exercise your dog every day. Regular exercise promotes bone, joint, muscle, and organ health. Walking can also eliminate boredom and provide mental stimulation. You can also create an exercise routine with your pet, such as climbing stairs, going for a hike, or running around the backyard. While different sizes and breeds of dogs require varying levels of exercise, creating an exercise routine with your four-legged friend is essential."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Challenge your dog's brain. Man's best friend benefits from mental stimulation. Teach your dog new tricks, play new games, and create puzzles. Since dogs have a heightened sense of smell, they love using their nose to explore. Try scattering a few treats around the home for your dog to find."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Create a slow-pace mealtime. Some dogs love gobbling up their food in one gulp. But eating too quickly may create digestive issues or result in vomiting. Slow down your dog's eating habits. Consider a puzzle feeder at mealtime or place a tennis ball in their food bowl so they have to eat around it."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Register your pup (depends on the place of residence). City and local pet laws often require dog owners to register their pets. Check your local municipality so you can ensure your dog is properly licensed. You'll want to attach the license to its collar to prove your dog is registered if it gets lost."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Consider a microchip. If your dog becomes lost, a microchip can help you locate your pet. Microchips are painless to implant and contain your contact information. They can usually be scanned at animal shelters and veterinary offices."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Secure trash, chemicals, and toxins around your home. Dogs are curious creatures, but sometimes their curiosity can put them at risk of injury or illness—especially when exploring your home. To keep your dog out of harm's way, secure your trash, toxins, and other chemicals found around the house."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Create a safe space for your dog. Dogs can feel anxious or stressed under certain situations, like the sound of thunder or noisy houseguests. Creating a safe space for your pet can provide comfort and security when it needs to retreat. Have a place in your home with some creature comforts such as a bed, blanket, toys, and fresh water."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Clean your dog's stuff. Washing your dog's toys, blankets, and bedding removes germs, dirt, pollen, and other things that can irritate your pet. Some dogs suffer from seasonal allergies, so make sure you wash your dog's bedding on a regular basis."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Keep food out of your dog's reach. Food items such as avocados, chocolate, and onions are toxic to dogs. Keeping these items out of their reach can help avoid some serious health consequences. Generally, you shouldn't give your pup “people food” like your leftovers. But some “people food” items such as plain chicken, plain rice, and canned pumpkin might be recommended by your vet for specific problems, like digestive issues."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Use a leash while in public. By always using a leash in public places, you can help your pet avoid accidents and injuries. For example, if your dog spots a squirrel and bolts after it, your dog could be at risk of getting hit by a car."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Train and Bond with Your Dog to Strengthen Your Relationship. Bonding and training your dog go hand-in-hand. By doing both, you are building a relationship of respect, communication, and companionship."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Prioritize one-on-one time with your pup. Dogs flourish on love and affection from their owners. Prioritizing daily interactions with your pet strengthens your bond. You can do so by petting, playing, and giving your dog treats."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Practice patience and consistency. Training a dog takes a lot of patience and consistency. Dogs can sense negative energy, so if they feel as though you're angry or agitated, they may not perform as well. If you're struggling to train your dog, consult with a professional or ask your vet for guidance. Remember, training your pup won't happen overnight, so stick with it—the results are worth it."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Consider positive reinforcement training. Practicing positive reinforcement training means you reward your pet for good behaviors and ignore the bad. This training method builds your dog's confidence, encourages cooperation, and increases tolerance. On top of that, it can bolster your bond with your canine."
      },
      {
        "Tip": "Plan for Unexpected Vet Bills with Pet Insurance. Even with the best planning and preventive measures, unexpected accidents and illnesses can still happen, which can result in major vet bills. For example, your dog might tear its cruciate ligament while chasing a ball or it might get sick with a serious illness such as cancer. A good way to help offset vet bills is with pet insurance. And it may be more affordable than you think."
